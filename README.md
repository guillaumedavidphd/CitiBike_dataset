# CitiBike dataset -- A simple analysis of NYC's bike share system

This repo contains my Jupyter Notebook with an analysis of the public CitiBike dataset. To have a look at the notebook, simply click on 'Citibike.ipynb'. A lot of information is included in the notebook.

I made two visualizations with Bokeh:

    - OverviewOfDailyTripsInOneWeek.html
    - OverviewOfHourlyTripsInOneDay.html
To view those, one has to save the HTML files locally first and then open them in a web browser. The explanation of what they are is in the notebook.
